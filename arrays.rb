 #ARRAYS
 #A common collection of data
 #a number inexed list
 #you could number each one by its position left to right
 #strings could be put in each box
 #elements can be added

 => ["Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Dessert"]

 #<< is the shovel operator and adds an element to the end of an array
 #convenience methods exist such as .last

 #.sort

  #.each will allow you to iterate through each element 
  #.join will let you mash up all as one
  #.index will allow you to find the address of a specific element
  #ask the array if an element is present with include?

  #use an array whenever you need a list where the elements are in specific order
